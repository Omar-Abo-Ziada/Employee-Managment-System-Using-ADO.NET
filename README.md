# **Employee Management System**

## **Overview**
Welcome to the **Employee Management System** project! This project is a mini application developed using **Windows Forms** in **C#** and connected to a **Microsoft SQL Server** database using **ADO.NET**. The system allows for the management of employees and departments within an organization.

## **Plot Twists**
Here's a quick rundown of the key elements of this project:

### **Three-Layer Architecture**
The project is structured with a **three-layer architecture**, comprising:
- **UI Layer:** Handles the user interface and interactions.
- **Business Logic Layer:** Processes raw data into an object-oriented form, encapsulating business rules and logic.
- **Data Access Layer:** Interacts directly with the database, abstracting database operations.

### **UI Layer**
This layer is responsible for the user interface and interaction logic, ensuring seamless user experiences.

### **Business Logic Layer**
The Business Logic Layer processes and transforms raw data from the Data Access Layer into an object-oriented form, encapsulating business rules and logic.

### **Data Access Layer**
The Data Access Layer interacts directly with the **Microsoft SQL Server** database, handling all database-related operations such as querying, updating, and deleting data.

### **Connecting C# with MS SQL**
**ADO.NET** is utilized to establish connections between **C#** and **Microsoft SQL Server**, facilitating seamless data interaction.

### **Displaying Departments and Employees**
The application accurately displays departments and their associated employees, ensuring correct data presentation.

### **Real-Time Data Updates**
The system supports real-time updates, allowing for the addition, removal, or updating of employee details with immediate effect.
